## Description
This website asks the user to input a number, and then it will return the range from 0-inputted number.  If the number contains a 3, it will print out "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that", a 2 will return "Boop", and a 1 will return "Beep".  If a number contains two of those numbers, it will prioritize the bigger number.
